# e-plantShopping

## Project Name: e-plantShopping (Paradise Nursery)

e-plantShopping is a React-based shopping cart application for an online plant shop called **Paradise Nursery**.  
This application allows users to browse a variety of house plants, add them to a shopping cart, manage quantities, and view the total cost dynamically.

The project is developed as a **final React project** and demonstrates component-based architecture, state management using **Redux Toolkit**, and dynamic UI updates.
